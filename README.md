## Project Overview
Founded in 2017, DrutoBazar is a fast-growing retail chain operating across 56 districts in Bangladesh, specializing in electronic goods, daily household items, home d√©cor and others. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, my role was to collaborate with stakeholders across Sales, Marketing, HR, and Retail Operations to design a SQL-based data warehouse, implement automated reporting, and develop interactive dashboards in Power BI. This initiative aimed to enhance data-driven decision-making, optimize performance tracking, and improve operational efficiency through advanced analytics and visualization.

## Executive Summary

### Sales Analysis (2022‚Äì2023)
- Over 800K+ sales records analyzed, revealing annual revenue of BDT 5.6 billion.
- Dhaka division contributed 21.37% of total sales.
- Electronics dominated revenue share with 41%, though this category had a 5.04% return rate.

### Key Deliverables as BI Analyst
- Designed and built a SQL-driven data warehouse to support enterprise-wide analytics.
- Developed multi-level access dashboards in Power BI for executives, managers, and team leads.
- Delivered quarterly summaries, monthly trends, week-over-week analysis, and automated daily reporting.
- Established scalable BI infrastructure for trend reporting, root cause analysis, and performance monitoring.

## Executive Dashboard Insights

### Revenue & Profit Trends
- Revenue grew consistently, peaking at BDT 237.49M in August 2023.
- Profit margins dipped to 26.82% in May 2023, indicating possible supplier cost increases, discount campaigns, or inefficiencies.

![Revenue & Profit Trends](assets/product_revenue.png)

**Insight:** Sustained revenue growth paired with declining profit margins reduces overall profitability.  
**Recommendation:** Introduce profitability KPIs into reporting and investigate cost optimization opportunities.

### Category Performance
- Top 5 categories contributed 92% of revenue; Electronics alone generated BDT 1.14B in 2023.
- Home D√©cor ranked 3rd in sales but achieved a 28.92% profit margin, showing pricing efficiency.

![Category Performance](assets/category_performance.png)

**Recommendation:** Apply margin optimization strategies to low-performing categories and explore cross-selling opportunities.

### Outlet & Sales Team Performance
- Top 10 outlets generated 18.19% of total sales (BDT 1.01B).
- Sylhet and Naogaon exceeded expectations (+1.85%), while Pabna lagged.
- Sales concentration is skewed‚Äîtop 10 salespeople drove 9% (BDT 494.3M) of revenue.

**Recommendation:** Develop training for underperforming outlets and incentive programs to balance sales distribution.

## Customer Dashboard Insights

### Customer Base Health
- Served 5,000 unique customers in 2023.
- Average revenue per customer: BDT 1.11M; AOV: BDT 6,964.46.

**Recommendation:** Segment customers by revenue tiers to personalize acquisition and retention strategies.

### Retention & Loyalty
- Loyalty program customers generated BDT 714.3M more than new customers.
- Top 100 customers contributed 59% (BDT 3.2B) of revenue, exposing concentration risk.

![Retention & Loyalty](assets/top_100.png)

**Recommendation:** Expand loyalty initiatives with tiered rewards and diversify acquisition channels to reduce dependency.

### Demographics & Segmentation
- Customers 55+ years contributed the most revenue (BDT 1.67B).
- Customers 18‚Äì25 years generated only BDT 0.78B with lower order values.

**Recommendation:** Target the younger segment with promotional campaigns while introducing premium bundles for older customers.

### Customer Champion
- Top customer Tahmina Islam placed 104 orders worth BDT 1.13M, contributing 8.16% of sales.

![Customer Champion](assets/top_customer.png)

**Recommendation:** Implement a customer success strategy to engage top spenders and mitigate dependency on individual customers.

- Top 10 products drove 43% (BDT 1.1B) of revenue.
- Products like Toasters had high sales but low margins.

![Sales vs Profitability](assets/revenue_by_product.png)

**Recommendation:** Re-negotiate supplier contracts or adjust pricing for high-volume, low-margin items.

### Returns Analysis
- Overall return rate: 4.95%.
- Daily Household Needs category accounted for the majority of returns, with deodorants being the most returned SKU.

**Recommendation:** Investigate return reasons, improve quality checks, and refine return policies.

### Least Profitable Products
- Some SKUs consistently unprofitable (e.g., Mango in Fresh Produce at -12% margin).
 
![Least Profitable Products](assets/top_least.png)

**Recommendation:** Phase out or reposition unprofitable SKUs unless strategically essential.

## Questions & Caveats
### Open Questions:
- How is a ‚Äúloyal‚Äù customer defined ‚Äî repeat purchase, program membership, or both?
- Can reason codes for returns be added to enhance root cause analysis?
- Are demographic fields (age, loyalty) fully populated?
- Are outlet and salesperson sales tracked independently?

### Assumptions & Limitations:
- Revenue and profit data assumed net of discounts and returns.
- Missing demographic fields may affect segmentation accuracy.
- In-store exchanges may not be fully logged in ERP returns data.
- Sales attribution assumed correctly tied to outlets/sales reps.

## 🧠 Business Problem

DrutoBazar, a rapidly growing retail chain with outlets across 56 districts in Bangladesh, faced a persistent challenge: managing and interpreting data from multiple, disconnected sources — databases, CRMs, ERP systems, marketing tools. This lack of integration created blind spots in performance tracking and slowed down critical decision-making. The Sales & Marketing teams were dealing with:

- Fragmented and inconsistent reports between departments  
- Delays of up to a week in receiving monthly performance updates  
- Missed opportunities to adjust campaigns in real time

## 🎯 Objective

| Goal | Description |
|---|---|
| **Consolidate Data** | Centralize critical sources into a SQL-based warehouse for unified access. |
| **Deliver Insights** | Build Power BI dashboards to track KPIs across all levels. |
| **Enable Access** | Apply role-based controls for secure, tailored data views. |
| **Prove Impact** | Analyze Q4 data to showcase value and business results. |

## 🛠️ Tools & Data

**Technologies used:**

- **SQL** — clean, normalize, and model data; joins & aggregations; structured schemas; manage data warehouse.  
- **Excel** — data exploration & validation; pivot tables; ad-hoc checks.  
- **Power BI** — data modeling (relationships, DAX calculations); dashboards with KPIs; automation with scheduled refresh.  

**Data sources:**

- ERP sales data (2022–2023) (~800,000 records)

This structure provided a holistic view of business performance across people, products, and outlets.

## ✨ Key Insights

- **Outlet Performance**  
  Jessore outlet exceeded its sales target by over 148k in Q4 2023 — strongest performer. Suggest piloting new products/promotions there.

- **Product Category**  
  Electronics topped revenue charts (≈ 0.29B). To further boost, prioritize stock availability and accessory bundling.

- **Customer Insight**  
  *Mr. Jamal Khan* emerged as highest-value customer last quarter: 31 products, generating ~0.48M revenue with ~0.12M profit. Zero returns → good product satisfaction / quality.
